## Summary Of Project
This project is a version of the popular TV show Countdown written in the racket programming language.

The application is going to define a function that takes two arguments. The first argument takes a number between 101 and 999 inclusive. The second function will be a list of numbers, taken from the list of 24 numbers avaiable.

The function should return the target number and then be able to calculate an equation to reach the number or get as close as possible to the target number.

The use of a negative number or a fraction are not allowed.
